    <p>Things have changed a bit this year.</p>

<p>As the Chinese New Year approached, everyone around me kept asking when I was going to go back home. It struck me as a bit odd because Shanghai now feels more like home to me.</p>

<p>Why does everyone assume that your home is where you were born - a place you can always return to? Can you really find the most comfort there? Do you feel most rejuvenated and safe when you’re there? No, I’m afraid that’s not the case for most people. Or perhaps most people haven’t really considered this question and just go by the habit that yes, of course, that’s where I’m from, and that’s where my family lives, so it must be home.</p>

<p>For me, that’s not the case at all. In fact, I’ve long noticed that I’m often more miserable when I’m back “home” than when I’m outside that area. Before, I would feel guilty about this, due to the moral reasoning I was taught growing up - that it’s the natural and right thing to do to stick with your family and always come back.</p>

<p>But no, you can choose wherever you want to be as long as you feel good. And if anything bugs you and you don’t think it’s worth your energy to fight back, you can simply stay away.</p>

<p>Sure, there must be some people who were born into a happy family and feel safe staying there. But for those who don’t have that, it’s necessary to find somewhere you truly feel you belong. It’s hard, but you have no choice. You are not doomed to be miserable where you came from - the whole world is waiting for you.</p>

<p>Another thing I find strange is that as the festival approaches, everything just seems to slow down. But it’s not a good kind of slow down. It feels more like people are living a hard daily life and finally find an excuse to not worry about the trivialities, to find a cover to hide behind - “Oh, everything that’s bothering me will be resolved after the festival.” “Now it’s holiday time, and we should all just chill out without thinking about anything else.”</p>

<p>But why? If the holiday time is when you feel most blessed, why can’t you just live every day like that?</p>

<p>I suppose we all grow up in a culture of always waiting for something better to happen. Life has been divided into different periods, with different tasks assigned to each. People make you believe that once you’ve gotten through a specific period, the difficulties will resolve - like when you were in primary school, the task was to get into a good middle school, then high school, choose a good college major, get a decent job. And then they’ll expect you to get married, have a child, and then what? You’re always waiting for the next thing to happen, always thinking that if that thing happens, everything will be fine and all problems will be solved.</p>

<p>Festivals exist for this reason - to create some ruptures in your life, to destroy the consistency of it. They make you feel this is a period where you can indulge yourself, and after it’s over, you’ll go back to your daily life. So now you have two versions of life - the normal, burdened daily grind, and your idealized version. No! If you want something, get it now. If you enjoy a certain lifestyle, just live that way!</p>

<p>These insights may seem banal, but it took me years and many reflections to finally realize them and be able to live by them without fear.</p>
